This project is a mini game "Knucklesbones" from the larger "Cult of the lamb" game
Rules of the game itself:

Players take turns rolling a single six-sided dice and placing it on their side of the board. Each player has their own 3x3 grid, and their score is the total of all the dice currently placed there. When one player has filled all nine slots on their board, the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins.

Each player's grid is divided into three columns. If a player has two or three dice showing the same number in a single column, their values are added together and multiplied by the number of matches.

If a player places a dice that matches one or more dice in their opponent's corresponding column, all of their opponent's matching dice are removed. This allows you to get rid of high-scoring dice, even doubles or triples, as long as you have somewhere for your matching dice to go.
